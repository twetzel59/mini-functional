# A tiny (programmable?) functional expression evaluator

This is my first experiment in making a programmable calculator. I was inspired by HP stack calculators and Haskell to pursue a mathematical mode of programming. So I set out to implement my own in my favorite language, Rust.

Although my interest was piqued by a concatenative language, I still intend to follow an applicative purely functional design.
